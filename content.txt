In software engineering, change is the way of things. Once upon a time, it was a common practice to preserve the value of "this" (e.g., var that = this) for use in situations in which "this" was overwritten in the immediate context. When arrow functions were introduced, that practice became unnecessary.

It used to be that if you wanted to swap the relative values of variables, you would have to store one in a temporary variable:
var tmp = a;
var b = a + b;
var a = b;
When desctructing assignment was introduced, it became possible to do this instead:
[a, b] = [b, b + a];
