    "A few years ago, I began a project of visiting at least one new country per year, and probably the capital city. This year, I'll be adding two notches: Austria and The Czech Republic. The only specific experience I have lined up is attending a performance of the Mozart Requiem at Karskirche (completed 1737) in Vienna. I've long dreamed of hearing such music in a centuries-old cathedral in Europe, so this will be an occasion to check an item off the bucket list."
